Hi, Iâ€™m Anatoly, a French-Russian creative professional with a diverse background in film direction, photography, art direction, and design. Iâ€™m also an avid programmer! My journey with computers began in 1989, programming in Pascal in Soviet-era Moscow.

My expertise spans several languages and technologies, including JavaScriptðŸ§¡, PHPðŸ’›, Perl, Bash, AppleScript, XML, JSON, SQL, HTML, SVG, and CSSðŸ’š, with some knowledge in C and C++. For me, programming is another creative tool, akin to a camera.

Most of my coding endeavors focus on:

- full-stack web development for proprietary sites since 1999
- crafting solutions for sound and video challenges in the film industry since 2011

While my work often isnâ€™t suited for open-source, I contribute some of my bits and pieces in areas that enhance user and dev experience, as well as through bug reports and feature suggestions to other projects.

My programming philosophy prioritizes practical solutions to business needs. I have a business degree and almost 30 years of practice as a co-founder. I advocate for Continuous Delivery, precise commits, strong typing, rigorous testing, and clear code documentation.

Active behind the camera since 1997, Iâ€™m based in Paris, Lausanne and LA, working globally. Iâ€™m trilingual English, French, and Russian.
