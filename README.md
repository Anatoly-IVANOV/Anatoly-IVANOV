Hi, Iâ€™m Anatoly, a French-Russian creative professional from Geneva with a diverse background in film direction, photography, art direction, and design. Iâ€™m also an avid programmer! My journey with computers began in 1989, learning Pascal in Soviet-era Moscow.

My expertise spans several languages and technologies, including JavaScriptðŸ’š, PHPðŸ’›, RustðŸ§¡, Python, Perl, Bash, Go, AppleScript, XML, JSON, SQL, HTML, SVG, and CSSðŸ’š, with some knowledge in C and C++. For me, runtimes, APIs and programming are creative tools, akin to storytelling and cameras.

Most of my coding endeavors focus on:

- full-stack web development for proprietary sites since 1999
- crafting solutions for sound and video challenges in the film industry since 2011

While my work often isnâ€™t suited for open-source, I contribute some of my bits and pieces in areas that enhance user and dev experience, as well as through bug reports and feature suggestions to other projects.

My programming philosophy prioritizes practical solutions to business needs. I have a business degree and almost 30 years of practice as a co-founder. I advocate for Continuous Delivery, precise commits, strong typing, rigorous testing, and clear documentation (Iâ€™m trilingual in English, French, and Russian).

Working globally â€” behind the camera or the monitor â€” since 1997, Iâ€™m typing away film and computer scripts from my bases in Paris, Lausanne and LA.
