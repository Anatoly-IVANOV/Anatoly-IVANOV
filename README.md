Hi, I’m @Anatoly-IVANOV, a French / Russian film director, DP, steadicam op, still photographer, art director, web / graphic designer, co-producer and… wait, what does all that have to do with programming and GitHub?! 🤣

I’ve lived with computers and have been programming “stuff” since 1989 (in Pascal 🤦🏻‍♂️ in then-Soviet Moscow). I’ve been working with JavaScript🧡, PHP💛, Perl, Bash, AppleScript, XML, JSON, SQL, HTML, SVG and CSS💚… and bits of C and C++.

To me, programming is a tool, just like a camera. So I’ve written a ton of code, but mostly for:

- proprietary web sites’ — back and front end
- solutions to image and video related problems we encounter in the cinema and photography world

Hence, not very open-sourceable or universally applicable (UTF8 IPTC recodes? AfterEffects ECMAscripts? PCM audio meta-data storage for year-long feature film shoots?)

So, here, on GitHub, I contribute as best as I can mostly with bug reports and feature suggestions.

I’m particularly interested in any tech that helps us automate tasks, improve user experience (code-driven UX design)… so we can focus on the few advantages we still have over machines: the creative stuff. 🙂

Behind the camera since 1997. Based in Paris FR and Geneva CH (remote pre- and post production, design). Working around the globe (on-site shoots / production / manufacturing).

Trilingual English / French / Russian.
